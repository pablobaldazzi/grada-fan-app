Build a white-label, multi-tenant football club mobile app (one app per club in the stores) using React Native + Expo for iOS + Android. The app must match the attached UI references (dark theme, rojo/rojinegro style, card-based modules, bottom tab bar, clean modern typography).

1) Product Goal

This is the fan-facing “club super app”: a single place where a fan can:

Hold and display a digital membership ID

Buy tickets (including seat selection)

Buy merch

Access exclusive benefits/discounts

Book experiences (events like meet & greet, training center visits)

Receive and browse push notifications

(Optional future) Access youth academy / school info and enrollment management

The platform behind it is multi-tenant: multiple clubs use the same system, but each club has its own branding, data, and modules.

2) White-label / Multi-app Requirements

We will publish a separate app per club (e.g., “Rojinegro App”, “Palestino Oficial”, etc.), but maintain one shared codebase.

Implement a Club Pack config system:

A folder per club (example /clubs/rangers/club.json) containing:

tenantKey, clubId, display name

theme colors, logos, fonts

deep link domain

feature flags/entitlements defaults

At build time, the app is built with a specific tenantKey so there is no club selector in the UI.

At runtime, the app calls a bootstrap endpoint to fetch:

Club branding (logo, colors, typography)

Enabled modules (features)

Legal URLs (privacy policy, terms)

Important URLs (support, tickets FAQ)

3) Core Modules to Include (MVP)

Implement these fan modules (each must be togglable per club via entitlements/feature flags):

Home

Welcome header with club name + crest

Next match card (“Próximo partido”) with CTA

Highlights / announcements

Rangers ID / Membership Card

Digital card UI exactly like reference: role (“Socio”), membership tier, member name, RUT/ID, birth date, expiration, barcode/QR

Ability to zoom/open full screen

“Present this card for access/benefits” text

Data from backend; cache locally for offline viewing

Tickets

List of events / matches

Ticket types, pricing, availability

Seat selection view (simplified seatmap like reference; zones + dots)

Cart + checkout flow

Display purchased tickets, QR codes, ticket details

Note: checkout can be web-based initially (secure hosted checkout) but must return to app and refresh order state.

Merch Store

Product grid like reference, categories, product detail

Add to cart

Cart screen shared with tickets (combined cart is OK)

Confirm and pay

Order history

Benefits / Discounts

“Beneficios exclusivos” feed

Filters chips (e.g., TODO, COMIDA, CAFÉ)

Benefit detail with redemption rules

“Near you” section (optional: location-based list)

Allow benefits to be restricted to members only

Experiences

List of experiences with limited slots

Detail + reserve CTA

Show “exclusive for members” + remaining seats

Notifications Center

In-app notification inbox (grouped by type: offers, tickets, promo, club)

Push notification deep links into relevant screens

4) Design Requirements (Match Provided Screens)

Style:

Dark UI (mostly black/charcoal background)

Strong primary accent color (club red) for CTAs, selected tab, buttons

Rounded cards, high contrast, clean layout, modern typography

Bottom tab bar with icons; selected tab highlighted in red

Minimal top bars with icons (search, menu, bell)

Screens to replicate structurally (based on images):

Membership card screen with barcode + member details

Benefits feed with category chips + discount cards

Home with “Rojinegro App” intro and next match CTA

Seat selection screen with dots grid and selected seats highlighted

Merch store grid with price tags + “Comprar” button

Cart summary with items (tickets + merch) and “Confirmar y pagar”

Academy / school screen listing “sedes disponibles” + manage enrollment CTA

Experiences list with reserve buttons

Notifications list with category labels + timestamps

Push notification example (copy style)

5) Architecture & Tech Stack

Frontend:

React Native + Expo

TypeScript

Navigation: @react-navigation (bottom tabs + stack)

State: lightweight approach (React Query + Zustand OR React Query + Context)

API client with typed responses

Local storage for cache/offline: SecureStore for tokens, AsyncStorage/MMKV for cached bootstrap and membership card

Push: Expo Notifications

Deep links: Expo Linking

Analytics: PostHog (include clubId, tenantKey, appBuildId) (we already use PostHog on the platform) 

app-summary

Backend assumptions (do not build backend, just integrate):

Our platform is multi-tenant and has modules for Clubs, Events, Orders, Fans, Tickets (QR), Seatmaps, Discounts, Campaigns, Ads, Domains, FanAuth, etc. 

app-summary

Authentication: Fan auth with magic link (email) or OTP (define a clean flow)

Endpoints should be assumed REST/JSON.

6) Feature Flags / Per-club Entitlements

Implement a simple entitlement system:

features: { tickets: true, merch: true, benefits: true, experiences: true, membershipId: true, academy: false }

UI must hide tabs/routes if disabled

Server can override with remote config

7) Security & Compliance

All network calls via HTTPS

JWT or session token stored in SecureStore

Do not log sensitive user data

Include Privacy Policy + Terms links from bootstrap config

Minimal permissions: only ask location if benefits “near you” is enabled; only ask notifications permission when user opts in.

8) Deliverables

Generate:

A working Expo RN app with the full navigation + screens

Reusable UI components matching the style (cards, buttons, chips, list items)

A mock API layer with sample data + clear interfaces to swap to real backend

Club Pack example (/clubs/rangers/club.json) and build-time selection pattern

Deep link routing for notifications (e.g., open a match, a benefit, an order)

A short README explaining:

how to run locally

how to switch clubs (build-time tenantKey)

where to plug in real API endpoints

9) Extra Nice-to-haves (if time)

Skeleton loaders

Empty states (no benefits, no upcoming matches)

Error handling with retry

Offline fallback for membership card + last tickets list

Light “admin/staff mode” placeholder for future check-in scanning (not required now)
